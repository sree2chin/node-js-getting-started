           An angel with innocent eyes and heavenly smile has been descended to earth letting me contemplate her exquisite beauty, made my soulless soul soulful, made my heart take over my consciousness and made me realise that this incarnation is not about petty worries but about love.

        Extension to Paulo Coelho's words:
        Warrior of light thinks that it will never happen again in his life, but it will happen with more intensity, yet he moves on. Sometimes that fragrance, those memories haunt him, yet he moves on. He thinks that he can control, but he will be devastated again, yet he moves on. He thinks that this will be the end of it, but deep down in his heart he knows that this is just a part of it. He thinks that it's not worth of what he is doing with his life for he don't even wake up in the morning with enthusiasm, yet he finds a way and moves on.

        If sometimes what we see is unreal for, some colors and things are not visible to the naked eye, we don’t have the knowledge of other worlds, then how can we decide what is real. We discovered many things, invented new things, Believed that what we are doing is real for, we have our own assumptions, facts and all. But never had found the answer for what life is and what we have to do. Nothing seems real in this world. but one aspect is for sure that I think life is not striving for it perpetually.

        What is love, Some people say our brain behaves pertaining to what it has gone through in the past and we behave accordingly, some say we can not define love, some psychologists made analysis of brain, made statistics, discovered patterns of thoughts of brain, invented new methodologies of how to analyse it, yet so powerful the brain is that it can not be understood for, there are infinitely many possible ways a person can think and there are infinitely many different kind of persons. Why can’t we control our sub-conscious mind with the conscious, even though we know that they are just memories by which we got the knowledge from eyes and, ears and touch, why can’t we erase them. If there is something greater that mind - soul, then what does it strive for and are we doing what is ought to be done here.

        Our desires, preferences etc are impacted  by our culture, our parents, our experience in life, friends, relatives, time, location and what not and they have become biased. We never knew what we truly want. If we were in 18th century, we would be in the anticipation of having a telephone and it would have given us a lot of happiness and now we will not even satisfy with one iphone. Starting a startup may be our goal now, In those days may be they just want peaceful life with whatever job or business they do. If we were raised in poor family, our preferences will be quite different when compared to wealthy people. 
       Over the time we changed a lot, our experience impacted a lot on us. However few aspects like our passion towards love, arts, beauty etc didn’t change, they are there from inception and still persist. They are innate, our basic natural instincts and are quintessential for life.

        Once there lived a beautiful woman who feels like she has every thing in the world and the happiest one for she has her baby which is the most wonderful and cute living thing to her that she devoted her life to her child. She raised her baby, gave him milk, felt happy by seeing her child grow, looked after him when he is not healthy, cooked for him, brought presents, taught him good manners, strived for her child to be the best and have respectable position in the society, cried many times for the sake of him, pacified him whenever he is in distress, always there with him holding his hand and showing the way and helped him in his difficult situations.
        After some days that kid got grown up and got married and slowly he's forgetting what he has been through in his childhood and what has happened and who were always there beside him in his life that he's completely racing against his life and perpetually working hard to make a better living for he has married and has a child to look after his'.
        After many years that beautiful woman who felt like, the one who is every thing to her, has left her and she is in great depression, dunno what to do. Her angel has left her and she has no one, for her life partner died a long ago and she has nothing to do with the life now and no one to care for she was left by her son with solitude.
