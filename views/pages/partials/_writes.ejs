        An angel with innocent eyes and heavenly smile has been descended to earth letting me contemplate her exquisite beauty, made my soulless soul soulful, made my heart take over my consciousness and made me realise that this incarnation is not about petty worries but about love.
      </p>

      <p class="light" style = "text-indent: 30px;">
        The time I wanted to ridicule the word love in my mind and beginning to hate myself and my life is the same time my throbbing heart wanted to say "I love you" to you.
      </p>

      <p class="light" style = "text-indent: 30px;">
        Perpetual Bliss: An absolute state where you feel completely contented and there is neither a need to talk nor act, it's a state where you just be still and contemplate the beauty thinking of nothing else.
      </p>

      <p class="light" style = "text-indent: 30px;">
        Spellbound by her beauty, he ran towards her all his life, but could never get close to her. It's as if he is running towards a place where earth and sky meet.
      </p>

      
      <p class="light" style = "text-indent: 30px;">
        Pouring rain, tears in eyes, going forward without any destination for he lost the one thing that he wants in life, lost hope to search for something against his will, he moved on without any purpose in a stateless mind.

      <p class="light" style = "text-indent: 30px;">
        Secret suffering: Of course physical pain is terrible than mental pain, however physical pain subsides with time and the later will never subside, neither increases nor is easy, it will just be there haunting thee for a life time like a big horrible, powerful devil who always sits by thy side and is ready to crush thee at any point of time. Good thing about pain is it makes human realise what is important in life and assuages worry caused by petty things and the con is that human can never know what he is afraid of in that pain.

        Superficial emotional intelligence and nirvana funda put aside, how come a person not want what he wants or want what he do not want as some people tell others to do, it’s highly self contradictory.
      </p>

      <p class="light" style = "text-indent: 30px;">
        Go neither in search of love nor strive for it, however don’t lose or ignore it when it comes in search of thee.
      </p>

      <p class="light" style = "text-indent: 30px;">
        Extension to Paulo Coelho's words:
        Warrior of light thinks that it will never happen again in his life, but it will happen with more intensity, yet he moves on. Sometimes that fragrance, those memories haunt him, yet he moves on. He thinks that he can control, but he will be devastated again, yet he moves on. He thinks that this will be the end of it, but deep down in his heart he knows that this is just a part of it. He thinks that it's not worth of what he is doing with his life for he don't even wake up in the morning with enthusiasm, yet he finds a way and moves on.
      </p>

      <p class="light" style = "text-indent: 30px;">
        If sometimes what we see is unreal for, some colors and things are not visible to the naked eye, we don’t have the knowledge of other worlds, then how can we decide what is real. We discovered many things, invented new things, Believed that what we are doing is real for, we have our own assumptions, facts and all. But never had found the answer for what life is and what we have to do. Nothing seems real in this world. but one aspect is for sure that I think life is not striving for it perpetually.
      </p>

      <p class="light" style = "text-indent: 30px;">
        What is love, Some people say our brain behaves pertaining to what it has gone through in the past and we behave accordingly, some say we can not define love, some psychologists made analysis of brain, made statistics, discovered patterns of thoughts of brain, invented new methodologies of how to analyse it, yet so powerful the brain is that it can not be understood for, there are infinitely many possible ways a person can think and there are infinitely many different kind of persons. Why can’t we control our sub-conscious mind with the conscious, even though we know that they are just memories by which we got the knowledge from eyes and, ears and touch, why can’t we erase them. If there is something greater that mind - soul, then what does it strive for and are we doing what is ought to be done here.
      </p>

      <p class="light" style = "text-indent: 30px;">
        As time passes by, our memories become vague however the pain and feelings remain the same.

      <p class="light" style = "text-indent: 30px;">
        Even when I am far from you, I can smell your fragrance, I can feel your warmth, I can see your smiling face, I can see your innocence.. You are the one I have in my heart.

        Once there lived a beautiful woman who feels like she has every thing in the world and the happiest one for she has her baby which is the most wonderful and cute living thing to her that she devoted her life to her child. She raised her baby, gave him milk, felt happy by seeing her child grow, looked after him when he is not healthy, cooked for him, brought presents, taught him good manners, strived for her child to be the best and have respectable position in the society, cried many times for the sake of him, pacified him whenever he is in distress, always there with him holding his hand and showing the way and helped him in his difficult situations.
        After some days that kid got grown up and got married and slowly he's forgetting what he has been through in his childhood and what has happened and who were always there beside him in his life that he's completely racing against his life and perpetually working hard to make a better living for he has married and has a child to look after his'.
        After many years that beautiful woman who felt like, the one who is every thing to her, has left her and she is in great depression, dunno what to do. Her angel has left her and she has no one, for her life partner died a long ago and she has nothing to do with the life now and no one to care for she was left by her son with solitude.

        Empathy is not just trying to think in the perspective of others, it is a process, it involves being patient, it involves listening to the other person, it involves going with his/her chain of thoughts and past experiences, his/her origin, culture, creed, analysing level of endurance and the list goes on. Only when we try to recognize some of these basic attributes of other person, then we can be empathetic to some extent.

        People say that death happens in fraction of a second, what we don’t recognize is that we are all in the process of death or going towards death which we can not obviate. From the moment we came onto this land, it is decided that in few years we had to die. It’s not a fraction of second, it’s years. Life is death. The question we should ask ourselves is what would we do in the little time we have before or in the process of death.

        Our desires, preferences etc are impacted  by our culture, our parents, our experience in life, friends, relatives, time, location and what not and they have become biased. We never knew what we truly want. If we were in 18th century, we would be in the anticipation of having a telephone and it would have given us a lot of happiness and now we will not even satisfy with one iphone. Starting a startup may be our goal now, In those days may be they just want peaceful life with whatever job or business they do. If we were raised in poor family, our preferences will be quite different when compared to wealthy people. 
       Over the time we changed a lot, our experience impacted a lot on us. However few aspects like our passion towards love, arts, beauty etc didn’t change, they are there from inception and still persist. They are innate, our basic natural instincts and are quintessential for life.

      </h4>

      <p class="light" style = "text-indent: 30px;">
        For the first time I wanted to write a review while/after reading a book.
        <br>Howard Roark is not just a character in the book, he is more than that, he’s the embodiment of Ayn Rand’s philosophy. He is un quivering force which cannot be moved to other’s will and can only manoeuvre by itself. He is not an egotist as the writer herself says in the introduction that she was not aware of the difference between egoist and egotist while she was writing the book. The book resonates with Ayn Rand’s ideology. I don’t agree with Ayn Rand calling objectivism as a philosophy. It’s not a philosophy, it’s the ultimate truth. This is the first book I ever read which is both fictional and non fictional.
        <br>Howard Roark! No explanations to fools, he just knows what to do with his life and what he wants in life. No one can change that. He can’t be moved. A person becomes like this when all the biases are removed and has his own passion, a complete rational being, the absolute human, the absolute talk, absolute sense. He is the purest form of soul who can not be manipulated by external beings or stupidity. I read few reviews which are against Ayn Rand as the book is way ahead of the time. This book will become more famous with time.
