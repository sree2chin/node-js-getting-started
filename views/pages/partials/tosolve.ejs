    <h4>Farmers:</h4>
    <p class = "light">
      India is an agrarian country with around 60% of its people depending directly or indirectly upon agriculture.
    </p>
    <p class = "light">
      From 1995 to 2013, a total of 296,438 Indian farmers committed suicide.
    </p>
    <p class = "light">
      As of 2017, one Indian farmer commits suicide every 30 minutes, due to a number of reasons including inadequate prices at the market, lack of government support, an extremely low government MSP (Minimum support price) and the vicious spiral of private money lenders and loans that the farmer is unable to pay back due to the above.
